Aegir DB Fix

I wrote this because we started working with early versions of aegir... and we / it would sometimes hang on various cleanup issues.

This is a set of MySQL commands that are used to go out and clean up the DB.

You will need to know the nid(s) of the sites that you want to clean out of the system.
This works for 'sites'. Not sure that it is what you want for platforms, etc.

As always... TAKE A BACKUP OF THE DATABASE BEFORE USING THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!

In general, it seems to return the Aegir database back to pristine regarding any 'clouded' site.

If you have questions or comments... please let me know.
